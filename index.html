            <h2>Introduction</h2>

            <h2>My Background</h2>
            <p>I believe for the longest time I have run away from anything "Coding" related, but lately, I seem to be drawn to codes people have written. Now, I just want to write my own code with bugs, and have something to keep me up at night.
            <p>On a soft note though, I love tech, and probably the reason why I agreed to study Electronics and Communications Engineering for BSc. Don't worry about my MSc, it's totally unrelated to Engineering. Well, except if you take it as engineering the mind, in this light, it'll make some sense. Currently, I churn on Data (data collection, training, analysis and visualization). :)</p>
